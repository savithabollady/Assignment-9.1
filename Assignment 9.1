1. If Z is norm (mean = 0, sd = 1)
Find P(Z > 2.64)
Find P(|Z| > 1.39)
2. Suppose p = the proportion of students who are admitted to the graduate school of the University of
California at Berkeley, and suppose that a public relation officer boasts that UCB has historically had a
40% acceptance rate for its graduate school. Consider the data stored in the table UCBAdmissions from
1973. Assuming these observations constituted a simple random sample, are they consistent with the
officerâ..s claim, or do they provide evidence that the acceptance rate was significantly less than 40%?
Use an Î± = 0.01 significance level.
